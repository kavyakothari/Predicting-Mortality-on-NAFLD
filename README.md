<h1>Predicting-Mortality-on-Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases</h1>
<p>By examining data sets from population research, this longitudinal study seeks to predict outcomes in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD patients and matched controls in the research were monitored for metabolic abnormalities, cardiac endpoints, and mortality. Using this substantial dataset, the project intends to create predictive models for metabolic abnormalities, cardiac events, and mortality in NAFLD. The results of this study will aid in improving the understanding of the long-term effects of NAFLD and in the creation of focused therapies to enhance patient outcomes.</p>
<p>The dataset employed in this study, "nafld1,csv," is made up of a thorough compilation of data acquired from a population study on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It has 17,549 observations across 10 variables, providing crucial knowledge regarding the characteristics and prognoses of NAFLD patients. The dataset provides information on demographic, anthropometric, and clinical factors that are associated with metabolic disorders, cardiac endpoints, and mortality.</p>
<p>The dataset nafld1 is a CSV file with 17549 observations on the following 10 variables. They are as follows: - id: Each participant in the study is given a unique identification number called a subject identifier. Using this variable, participants can be tracked and distinguished throughout the investigation. age: The "age" variable in the dataset tells us how old each person was when they joined the study. height: The height variable records the height of each subject, measured in centimeters. It enables the calculation of body mass index (BMI) and helps evaluate the impact of height on NAFLD-related complications. bmi: The body mass index represents the calculated BMI of each subject, which is derived from their weight and height measurements. BMI serves as a valuable indicator of obesity and its association with NAFLD progression. case.id: The case identifier variable links each subject to the corresponding NAFLD case to which they are matched. This matching allows for comparative analyses between NAFLD cases and control subjects. ‘futime’: The ‘futime’ variable denotes the duration from the initial entry into the study until either the occurrence of death or the most recent follow-up. It provides crucial information about the length of the follow-up period for each subject. </p>
